# IrrVerbPicker

**Source code and documentation are mostly in English. Since this project targets mainly English teachers and English learners in Germany some bits and pieces (e.g. error messages) are written in German.**

IrrVerbPicker is a program that picks random elements from a list of irregular English verbs. Learners of English as a foreign language and English teachers can use it to revise the long list of irregular verbs.
 
It is possible to choose the amount of verbs you want to pick and which grammatical form or combination of forms you want to display. The lists of irregular verbs match the Bavarian version of the Green Line series (G9/E1).
